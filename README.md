Hi, I'm Kamila and I'm currently a PhD student at Université libre de Bruxelles. In my research I work on reduced-order modeling of turbulent reactive flows. My research is supported by the F.R.S.-FNRS Aspirant Research Fellow grant.

If you would like to join any of my ongoing projects, send me a suggestion for improvements or a comment, drop me a line at: `kamilazdybal at gmail dot com`.

## Ongoing projects:

► I develop [**Science Docs**](https://kamilazdybal.github.io/science-docs/) - a site with science tutorials and articles, study notes and coding projects for curious minds!

► Check out our [**Pinguino Lecture Series**](http://boccelliengineering.altervista.org/PLS_website/index.html) - a yearly, multidisciplinary symposium where we share our knowledge and research with anyone in the audience! *The date and place for the 4th lecture series will be scheduled soon!*

## News:

► Check out our recent [SoftwareX publication](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S2352711020303435)! [**PCAfold**](https://pcafold.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source Python library for generating, analyzing and improving low-dimensional manifolds obtained *via* Principal Component Analysis.
