I'm Kamila and I'm currently a PhD student at UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles. In my research I work on reduced-order modeling of turbulent reactive flows.

I also develop [**Science Docs**](https://kamilazdybal.github.io/science-docs/), a site with tutorials, articles, coding projects and study notes for curious minds!

Check out our [**Pinguino Lecture Series**](http://boccelliengineering.altervista.org/PLS_website/index.html) - a yearly, multidisciplinary and revolutionary symposium where we share our knowledge and research with anyone in the audience! *The 4th lecture series date and place to be scheduled soon!*

> My research is supported by the F.R.S.-FNRS Aspirant Research Fellow grant.
